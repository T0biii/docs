## Uber's 3-Step Approach to Getting More Engineers to Document

Excerpts from Stephanie Blotner's blog on [Uber's 3-Step Approach to Getting More Engineers to Document](https://slab.com/blog/ubers-apporach-to-getting-more-engineers-to-document/):

Two common writing bugs Blotner's seen over the years are:
1. Lack of empathy - Engineers may not fully consider their audience when writing, which can lead them to confuse the reader with either too little, or too much, context.
2. Grammar - Many people default to the passive voice, but technical documentation is more actionable when written in the active voice.

While grammar is a concrete concept, empathy is not. That can make it harder to teach others. But at Uber, they’ve made this experience as concrete as possible. They’ve created a checklist of questions engineers can ask themselves to ensure they keep their audience's needs in mind.

Questions like "who is the audience," "what is their workflow," and "what are their pain points" keep the audience top-of-mind. Overall, Blotner hasn’t found too many engineers who struggle with understanding why empathy is important. “I think [that's] because they’ve experienced it themselves,” she says. “They’ve been on the receiving end [of poor documentation].”

## How Stripe Built a Writing Culture

Excerpts from David Nunez's blog on [How Stripe Built a Writing Culture](https://slab.com/blog/stripe-writing-culture/):

“You wouldn’t ship code without having it reviewed; your words are just as important,” says Nunez.

Visuals and diagrams simplify documents. They make them more approachable, which is why he suggests whenever you can replace text with diagrams, do it.

Diagrams or not, everyone on your team should consider the visual aspect of their writing. Here are a few items to consider:
1. Keep paragraphs short (3–4 sentences). If possible, make the first paragraph of a document 2–3 sentences.
2. Use subheads and bulleted lists to break up walls of text.
3. Consider your audience when writing. Some audiences value complex words — some don’t. The goal is to find the most compelling language for the audience you need to reach and act on your document.
4. Edit frequently. Edit your own work, and ask peers to edit it as well. Editing is the key to getting the best clarification of your idea.
