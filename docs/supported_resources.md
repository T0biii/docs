title: Supported resources
---

The quickest way to find out if your Terraform resources are supported is to [run Infracost](/docs#installation) with the `--show-skipped` option. This option also shows unsupported, but free, resources that were skipped.

Infracost currently supports the following Terraform resources, using On-Demand prices. In some cases, AWS Spot prices are also supported, but AWS Reserved Instance prices are not supported since it is difficult to tell from Terraform resources whether they could be utilized.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

| Service name | Main Terraform resources      | Notes |
| ---          | ---                           | ---   |

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Coming soon! Please watch and üëç [this](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/24) for updates.

### The resource I want isn't supported

We're regularly adding support for new resources - be sure to [watch the repo](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/) for new releases. We plan to add support for more cloud vendors ([Azure](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/64)) and other IaC tools ([Pulumi](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/187), [CloudFormation](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/190)) too. Please watch and üëç them if you'd like us to work on them sooner.

You can help by:
1. [Creating an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/new) and mentioning the resource you need and a little about your use-case; we'll try to prioritize it depending on the community feedback.
2. [Contributing to Infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost#contributing). You can join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/rXCTaH3) if you need help contributing.
