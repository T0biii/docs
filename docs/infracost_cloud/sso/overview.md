Infracost Cloud supports authenticating with Enterprise SSO providers. To set up SSO with Infracost Cloud follow one of the following guides:
* [Azure Active Directory](azure_active_directory.md)
* [Okta](okta.md)
* [Google Workspace](google_workspace.md)
* [Other SAML providers](other_saml.md)

Once your SSO connection is configured any user authenticating with the your company domain name in the [usual log in page](https://dashboard.infracost.io) will be redirected to your SSO provider for authenticating.
