See the [Infracost actions](https://github.com/infracost/actions/) repo for instructions and examples. 

If you used the older [infracost-gh-actions](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-gh-action) repo, please see our [migration guide](guides/actions_migration.md).

You can also use the [**Infracost GitHub App**](/docs/integrations/github_app/) if you prefer an automated integration so you can add Infracost to many repos quickly and not worry about updating the CLI.
